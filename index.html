<h1>Debbie Johnson's Portfolio</h1>
  <p>Below you will find a list of the projects I have completed in my first week at Epicodus.</p>
<h2>My Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>My First Webpage - this was the first page I created in class. It uses HTML, and has no styling. It's very basic!</li>
  <li>My Pet - this is the page I created for my cat, LB. I used HTML and CSS. This page is a summary of all the things I love about my cat, and includes his photo.</li>
  <li>Cupcake Shop Page - this page uses HTML, and CSS. I used this page to practice using a variety of HTML tags and experimented with different styles.  </li>
</ul>
