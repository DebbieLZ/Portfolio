<h1>Debbie Johnson's Portfolio</h1>
  <p>Below you will find a list of projects (with links) that I have completed in my first week at Epicodus.</p>
<h2>My Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/DebbieLZ/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage</a> - this was the first project I created in class. It uses HTML, and has no styling. It's very basic!</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/DebbieLZ/my-pet.git">My Pet</a> - this is the project I created for my cat, LB. I used HTML and CSS. This page has a summary of all the things I love about my cat, and includes his photo.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/DebbieLZ/Cupcake-Shop.git">Cupcake Shop</a> - this project uses HTML, and CSS. I used this project to practice using a variety of HTML tags and experimented with different styles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="img/Me.jpeg" alt="A photo of Me.">
<p>I currently live in Denver, Colorado with my husband and cat. I come from a completely different professional background than programming, but I am very excited to embark on something new. I have a Bachelor's in Marketing and a Master's in Public Health. For the past ten years, I have worked almost exclusively for government and non-profit agencies. Most of my work has revolved around community health and communicable disease. I have been interested in programming for many years, as I have several friends who work in the field. I finally decided to go for it, so I enrolled in Epicodus. My dream is to one day work as a web developer for an organization I believe in.</p>
