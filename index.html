  <h2>My Projects:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/DebbieLZ/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage</a> - this was the first project I created in class. It uses HTML, and has no styling. It's <em> very</em> basic!</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/DebbieLZ/my-pet.git">My Pet</a> - this is the project I created for my cat, LB. I used HTML and CSS. This page has a summary of all the things I love about my cat, and includes his photo.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/DebbieLZ/Cupcake-Shop.git">Cupcake Shop</a> - this project uses HTML, and CSS. I used this project to practice using a variety of HTML tags and experimented with different styles.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>I currently live in <a href="https://denvergov.org/Home">Denver</a>, Colorado with my husband and cat. I come from a completely different professional background than programming, but I am <strong>very excited</strong> to embark on something new. I have a Bachelor's in Marketing and a Master's in Public Health. I have worked almost exclusively for government and non-profit agencies. Most of my work has revolved around community health and communicable disease. I have been interested in programming for many years, as I have several friends who work in the field. I finally decided to go for it, so I enrolled in Epicodus. My dream is to one day work as a web developer for an organization I believe in.</p>
  <h2>My Interests and Hobbies:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Outdoor activities</li>
      <li>Learning to play the drums</li>
      <li>Live music</li>
      <li>Painting and drawing</li>
    </ol>
